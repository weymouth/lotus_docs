This repository contains documentation on how to work with Lotus. Namely, the following directories are contained,

- **BDIM**: About the Boundary Data Immersion Method implemented in Lotus.
- **Build**: Build and run Lotus from the source files in your local computer. 
- **Docker**: Run Lotus using a Docker container (no need to build).
- **Examples**: lotus.f90 files for different test cases.
- **Fortran**: About Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Fortran.
- **HPC**: Contains information on running Lotus in Iridis4 building the solver from the source files, and to run Lotus in Iridis5 using Singularity, the HPC alternative for Docker.
- **HTML docs (not updated)**: Documentation of Lotus in HTML pages. It's not currently updated, but ideally everything should be maintained here in the future.
